;                        MSP430 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
; 
;  MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
;  demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
;  concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
;  register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
;  be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
;  effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware
;  for an API functional library-approach to peripheral configuration.

;   MSP430F54xA Demo - 32x32 Signed Multiply
;
;   Description: Hardware multiplier is used to multiply two numbers.
;   The calculation is automatically initiated after the second operand is
;   loaded. Results are stored in RES0, RES1, RES2 and RES3.
;
;   ACLK = 32.768kHz, MCLK = SMCLK = default DCO
